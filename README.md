# DragonIK-VRIK


This is an example project demonstrating the VRIK functionality of the DragonIK plugin. The example project is currently barebones, but quite functional. Improvements will be added later. Those who use Oculus Quest might have the hand rotations offseted around 90 degrees as this was currently only tried in the htc vive.

A link to the binary so you can directly try the application without purchasing anything : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ppEV-YLODH7_YiVWpxK81iiqyZXc2f38/view?usp=sharing

In case of hand rotation offsets, it can easily be tweaked in the animbp nodes. Visit my discord if you have any doubts.
